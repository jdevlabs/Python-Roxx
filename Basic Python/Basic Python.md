Basic Python
=========

For the "basic python" each one of you has to develop a "python module". A module is to Python what a header file is to C/C++. We are providing you a few ideas upon which your module might be based. Although, you are encouraged to think up an idea for yourself and work on it. After each class each module's functionality will get denser, so choose wisely.

Idea 1: [Simulating Logic Circuits](#logic)  
Idea 2: [Waves and Harmonics](#wave)  
Idea 3: [Numerical Methods](#nm)  
Idea 4: [Text Processor](#text)  


#### <a name="logic"></a> Simulating Logic Circuits

You all know what logic circuits are. They were (are) the part of your syllabus in 3rd semester. In this module you'll be simulating logic circuits - AND, OR, NOT, NAND, XOR, XNOR. As you learn more python you will make your module better and more functional. For subtasks and basic start guide, head to - [here]().

#### <a name="wave"></a> Waves and Harmonics

The theme of this study is to demonstrate Fourier's method for finding the harmonic amplitudes from a sampled wave. Yeah, I copied it from somewhere. Anyway, the main task in this module is to make a wave class through which, we will be able to add, multiply, divide, and subtract waves in order to add in (and subtract out) harmonic frequencies. The class might also have a method to plot the wave on the screen (if you are willing to go that). For subtasks and basic start guide, head to - [here]().

#### <a name="nm"></a> Numerical Methods

Again, most of you must be familiar with this. This module will implement various numerical methods, namely, *numerical integration*, *interpolation methods* and *numerical differentiation*. For subtasks and basic start guide, head to - [here]().

#### <a name="text"></a> Text Processor

This is something you might have done in very basic form in your C lab. Here, text processor does not mean a word processor (that is, editing and formatting of text documents) instead it means automated processing of text. You'll do some regex search, derive some statistics out of the text and working with HTML documents (HTML parser).
