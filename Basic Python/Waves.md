Waves and Harmonics
=========

- Start by making a class "Wave".
- Create functions in wave which implement different formulae.
- Use these functions to solve the harmonics
- You will be needing the knowledge of 'classes', 'loops', and 'functions'.
- Display the generated harmonics in a graph plot.
- For this you will need to learn 'matplotlib'.
