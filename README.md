These classes are divided in 3 major modules-

1. Basic Python
2. Django
3. Data Science

When we decided to start these classes we planned on making them projects based, that is, for each module of the class you'll be asked to create a project (either in groups or individually). Here goes the projects' description.


### Basic Python

For the "basic python" each one of you has to develop a "python module". Python module is what a header file is called in Python. We are providing you a few ideas of what your module might do. Although, you are encouraged to think up an idea for yourself and work on it. After each class each module's functionality will get denser.

Idea 1: [Simulating Logic Circuits](https://github.com/jdevlabs/Python-Roxx/blob/master/Basic%20Python/Basic%20Python.md#logic)  
Idea 2: [Waves and Harmonics](https://github.com/jdevlabs/Python-Roxx/blob/master/Basic%20Python/Basic%20Python.md#wave)  
Idea 3: [Numerical Methods](https://github.com/jdevlabs/Python-Roxx/blob/master/Basic%20Python/Basic%20Python.md#nm)  
Idea 4: [Text Processor](https://github.com/jdevlabs/Python-Roxx/blob/master/Basic%20Python/Basic%20Python.md#text)  

Other section will be updated as we approach further.
